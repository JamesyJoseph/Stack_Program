# Stack
<p>This program implements a <i><b>stack</b></i> using an array and allows the user to perform basic stack operations: push, pop and display. 
  The program prompts the user to enter the stack size and offers a menu to choose an operation. 
<ol>
<li>Push adds an element to the stack (if it's not full).</li>
<li>Pop removes and displays the top element (if the stack is not empty).</li>
<li>Display shows all elements in the stack.</li>
</ol>
The program handles overflow and underflow conditions appropriately, and continues until the user chooses to exit.</p>
